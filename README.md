# Seraph
Seraph is a Hypixel statistic mod designed for [Weave](https://github.com/Weave-MC).


### Background
Seraph was a passion project I started in 2019 with [Kay](https://github.com/Clemintina), and since then have stopped development on. This is a remake and cleanup of the original mod we created, with more features, cleaner structure, and faster responses.

*Special thanks to [yabqy](https://github.com/yabqy) and [Directives](https://github.com/DirectivesMods) for the help on the original TabStats mod <3*


### Features
* Detailed and customizable statistics for Hypixel
* Streamlined API wrapper for Hypixel, making it easy to fetch and parse data
* GLSL shaders for most rendering, providing high-quality graphics
